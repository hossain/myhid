Hidden application management utility
Long time ago I needed a utility to hack my own Windows in a shared computer. There wasn't any suitable tool back then. I wrote a windows application in VC++ so I can hide any window I want.

Years passed and I added these features to that tiny little utility:

- Executes commands in specified time or specified period (Minimum 1 second)
- Manage windows (Hide, Show, Close) based on their name
- Send keystroke or key sequences to specified windows (string or key codes)
- Launch application or command in hidden or visible mode
- Shutdown, Reboot, Logoff
- Terminate specified process
- Machine based actions (Run a command if ping to the specific machine responded)

The program runs in background mode and uses the hidden config. For example if you want to hide a window you just need to change config file and save it.

Hackers can use this tool to perform machine based actions. For example bla bla bla.

Now I am releasing executable and source code of this powerful beast to the public. Don't hesitate to participate or fork.

Note that this program is intended for IT professionals and hackers. Novice users can damage or slow their windows, and there is absolutely no garantee to any use/misuse/bad use of this utility or it's source code.
